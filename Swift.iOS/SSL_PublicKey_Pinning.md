# SSL Pinning Or Public Key Pinning

Most of the client application (mobile apps, or a web client) get its data from server  over `https`.  When the ap exchange information, they typically use the `Transport Layer Security (TLS)` protocol to provide secure connection. Even if `TLS` protect the transmitted data from temparing, attackers can setup  `man-in-the-middle` attacks using self-signed certificates. With these certificate they can capture data moving to and from your apps. Detail tutorial on how we can use `man-in-the-middle` attack  here [Using Charles Proxy to Debug HTTPS connection](https://github.com/tigerraj32/Cheetsheet-Collection/blob/master/CharlesProxy.md)

To protect this `man-in-the-middle` attack it is required we imppement `SSL Certificate Pinning`.

**So what is `Certificate Pinning` ?**

`Certificate Pinning ` force your client application to validate the server's certificate agains a known copy of server certificaet while making secure communication with server. 


# How does SSL Works ?

There are multiple events occuring when making a single `https` connection.

![](../resources/tls_connection.jpg)

- Client machine sends a connection request to server, server listens the request.
- Server gives response including public key and certificate.
- Client checks the certificate and sends a encrypted key to server.
- Server decrypt the key and sends encrypted data back to the client machine.
- Client receives and decrypt the encrypted data.


# Types  of SSL Pinning

- **Pin the certificate:**

   You can download the server’s certificate and bundle it into your app. At runtime, the app compares the server’s certificate to the one you’ve embedded. 
   
  - Disadvantage:
  
    This is not the preffred method for mobile application because typically every certificate have a validity life span. Once expired we need to renew or generate new one. This will require us to bundle this certificate in app again and release new build. If not done on time then app will stop working

- **Pin the public key:**
  
   You can retrieve the certificate’s public key and include it in your code as a string. At runtime, the app compares the certificate’s public key to the one hard-coded in your code.

  - Advantage

    This is the preffered method of `SSL Pinning` for mobile appilcation. Because the `public key hash` is never going to change.



# How to get SSL Certificate

Here I am going to demonstrate SSL Pinning for getting github repoitoty list using `github public api`.  There are multiple ways we can extract `Public SLL Certificate`

**Method 1:** From Browser

- Open the browser and hit `github.com`
- In the address bar you will see the lock icon indicating that this is a secure site.
- Click on this `lock icon`, this will open a window that shows the detail of certificate. 
- Click the `root certificate` and drag it to `Desktop`
- Now you have a `ssl certificate` which you can bundle into the application to implement `ssl pinning`

![](../resources/extract_ssl_crt.gif)

**Method 2:** From Terminal

We can use `openssl` and `s_client` to generate the certificate.   First of all copy and paste below command in terminal

```
openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 </dev/null  
```

Once it completes, you'll receive a lot of data including a list of certificates. Each certificate in the chain has a Common Name (CN).

```
Certificate chain
 0 s:/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=GitHub, Inc./CN=github.com
   i:/C=US/O=DigiCert, Inc./CN=DigiCert High Assurance TLS Hybrid ECC SHA256 2020 CA1
 1 s:/C=US/O=DigiCert, Inc./CN=DigiCert High Assurance TLS Hybrid ECC SHA256 2020 CA1
   i:/C=US/O=DigiCert Inc/OU=www.digicert.com/CN=DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA
```
Below that, you can see the actual certificate you're interested in, which is the one where CN is githubcom.

```

To copy the certificate into a file, use openssl again. Repeat the previous command and pass its output to openssl x509, specify DER encoding and output it to a new file named github.com.der:

```
openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 </dev/null  | openssl x509 -outform DER -out github.com.der
```
