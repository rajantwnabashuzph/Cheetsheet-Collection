# Introduction

`Machine Learning (ML)` is a mordern software development technique that enables computer to lean and impprove from experence without being explicitly programmed to do so and solve the new problem by using the sets of real world data sets. It is a part of broader field of `Articifical Intelligence AI`. `AI` is a field concerned with capability of machine to perform activities using human-like intelligence. 

There are many types of `Machine Learning`  algorithm. Some of them are as below

- `Supervised Learning`: 
        
    In this type of algorithm every sample data from train model have it corresponding output or label. Hence it can be use to predict the output value for specific inputh. 

- `Unsupervised Learning`
- `Reinforcement Learning`
