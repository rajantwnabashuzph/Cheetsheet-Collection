# ATMega328

Arduino Uno is based on the ATmega328 by Atmel. The high-performance Microchip picoPower 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 
- 32KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 
- 1024B EEPROM, 2KB SRAM, 
- 23 general purpose I/O lines, 
- 32 general purpose working registers, 
- three flexible timer/counters with compare modes, 
- internal and external interrupts, 
- serial programmable USART, 
- a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 
- a 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8-channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), 
- programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, 
- and five software selectable power saving modes. The device operates between 1.8-5.5 volts.
