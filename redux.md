# Redux

## What is Redux ?

- Redux is state management library for  java script  such as react, angular, veu.
    
## When to use ?

- In a application that have complex UI, we need to listen to change in one part of UI and immediately need to change in another part of UI.

- The change in data can be because of network request  or background task or some asynchronous  task.

- Managing data  or state in such app is very complex with out state management solution. Some of  such state management solution are , 
    - Flux (created by Facebook)
    - Redux (inspired by Flux)
    - Mobx

## How redux works ?
   
- In redux instead of scattering the application state in various part of application UI, we store it in a central repository that is a single javascript object called store (a kind of database for front end)

- So different part of ui no longer need to maintain it own state instead they get or store in store.

- If something goes wrong, Redux can show how the change happened and why transparently.

- In short, Redux centralizes our application state and makes data flow transparent and predictable.


## Three Fundamental Principle in Redux

### Actoin

Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using  **store.dispatch().**

Actions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed. Types should typically be defined as string constants. Once your app is large enough, you may want to move them into a separate module.


Sample **action.js**
- Action Types

```js
        const ADD = 'bugAdded'
        const REMOVED = 'bugRemoved'
        const RESOLVED = 'bugResolved'
```        

- Action Creator

Action creators are exactly thatâ€”functions that create actions. In redux, action creators simply return an action

```js
    export const bugAdded = (text) => {
        return { 
            type: actionTypes.ADD,
            payload: {
                desc: text
                }
            }
    }

    export const bugRemoved = (bugId) => ({
        
            type: actionTypes.REMOVED,
            payload: {
                id: bugId
            }
        
    })

    export const bugResolved = (bugId) => ({
        
        type: actionTypes.RESOLVED,
        payload: {
            id: bugId
        }

    })
```
