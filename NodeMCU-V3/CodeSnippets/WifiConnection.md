# Connect to Wifi Network

## WiFi Mode : WIFI_STA (Station)

Devices that connect to Wi-Fi networks are called stations (STA). Connection to Wi-Fi is provided by an access point (AP), that acts as a hub for one or more stations. The access point on the other end is connected to a wired network. An access point is usually integrated with a router to provide access from a Wi-Fi network to the internet. Each access point is recognized by a SSID (Service Set IDentifier), that essentially is the name of network you select when connecting a device (station) to the Wi-Fi.

ESP8266 modules can operate as a station, so we can connect it to the Wi-Fi network.

## Soft Access Point

An access point (AP) is a device that provides access to a Wi-Fi network to other devices (stations) and connects them to a wired network. The ESP8266 can provide similar functionality, except it does not have interface to a wired network. Such mode of operation is called soft access point (soft-AP). The maximum number of stations that can simultaneously be connected to the soft-AP can be set from 0 to 8, but defaults to 4.


### Uses

- The soft-AP mode is often used and an intermediate step before connecting ESP to a Wi-Fi in a station mode. This is when SSID and password to such network is not known upfront. ESP first boots in soft-AP mode, so we can connect to it using a laptop or a mobile phone. Then we are able to provide credentials to the target network. Then, the ESP is switched to the station mode and can connect to the target Wi-Fi.

- Another handy application of soft-AP mode is to set up mesh networks. The ESP can operate in both soft-AP and Station mode so it can act as a node of a mesh network.

### Notes:

- The network established by softAP will have default IP address of 192.168.4.1. This address may be changed using softAPConfig (see below).
Even though ESP8266 can operate in soft-AP + station mode, it actually has only one hardware channel. Therefore in soft-AP + station mode, the soft-AP channel will default to the number used by station. For more information how this may affect operation of stations connected to ESP8266â€™s soft-AP, please check this FAQ entry on Espressif forum.
