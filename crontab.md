## Verify crontab job 

Since cron tab jobs are executed in background it is not that clear if the job is executed or not. 
In order to verify the job status  we can print some status text after executing completes in a file. 
Then we monitor that file, as below

###Content of script.sh

```bash
echo "hello" > ~/var/log/job_log.txt
```

Now monitor using foollowing command

    tail -f /var/log/job_log.txt
