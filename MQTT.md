# Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)

`MQTT` is extremely lightweight `pubish subscribe` messaging protocol  that transport message between device 
over the TCP/IP. It is desiggn for bidirectional connection between remotely placed device 
(specialy used for iOT devices) with  `small code footprint`.



Some of the key features of MQTT 

### Lightweight and Efficient

MQTT clients are very small, require minimal resources so can be used on small microcontrollers. MQTT message headers are small to optimize network bandwidth.

### Bi-directional Communications

MQTT allows for messaging between device to cloud and cloud to device. This makes for easy broadcasting messages to groups of things.

### Scale to Millions of Things

MQTT can scale to connect with millions of IoT devices.

### Reliable Message Delivery

Reliability of message delivery is important for many IoT use cases. This is why MQTT has 3 defined quality of service levels: 0 - at most once, 1- at least once, 2 - exactly once

### Support for Unreliable Networks

Many IoT devices connect over unreliable cellular networks. MQTTâ€™s support for persistent sessions reduces the time to reconnect the client with the broker.

### Security Enabled

MQTT makes it easy to encrypt messages using TLS and authenticate clients using modern authentication protocols, such as OAuth.
